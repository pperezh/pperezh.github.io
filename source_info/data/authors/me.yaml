bio: |
  I graduated as a Biotechnology Engineer from the University of Chile, where I also completed my Ph.D. in Cell and Developmental Biology. Enriched by my research experiences abroad at UC Davis and University of Ghent, I moved to California to pursue fundamental biological questions, joining UC Riverside as a Postdoctoral Researcher in 2016. Later, I advanced to an Assistant Project Scientist role, and in 2024, I joined the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My research is focused on coordinate cellular pattern formation and hormone signaling.
