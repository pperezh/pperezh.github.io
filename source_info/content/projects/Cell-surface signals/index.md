Uncovering the mechanisms of extranuclear auxin perception and signaling at the plasma membrane.

My research challenges the traditional view that auxin signaling occurs primarily in the nucleus. We identified **ABL1 and ABL2** (ABP1-like proteins) as new auxin-binding proteins that physically interact with **Transmembrane Kinases (TMKs)** at the cell surface. This work demonstrates that ABLs and TMKs act as co-receptors to perceive extracellular auxin, triggering rapid cellular responses independent of transcriptional changes.

Additionally, I investigate how these signaling components are organized into dynamic **membrane nanodomains**. These nanoclusters of lipids and proteins (such as ROP GTPases) act as the fundamental "building blocks" of cell polarity, translating uniform chemical signals into localized growth responses. This project bridges the gap between signal perception and the rapid cytoskeletal reorganizations required for plant development.
