description: 'My work attempts to bridge cell biology from an engineering perspective. My work treats a cell as a dynamic, responsive unit that utilizes "molecular logic gates"—such as auxin signaling hierarchies and polarized receptor-like kinases—to tune the developmental programs to its environment. By combining advanced quantitative imaging with biomechanical characterization and modeling, I investigate how these cells adaptively "print" tissue patterns like the interdigitated geometry of the flat epidermal leaf or the radial architecture of the root.'
