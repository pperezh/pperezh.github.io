abstract: "Cell polarity is intimately linked to numerous biological processes, such as oriented plant cell division, particular asymmetric division, cell differentiation, cell and tissue morphogenesis, and transport of hormones and nutrients. Cell polarity is typically initiated by a polarizing cue that regulates the spatiotemporal dynamic of polarity molecules, leading to the establishment and maintenance of polar domains at the plasma membrane. Despite considerable progress in identifying key polarity regulators in plants, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cell polarity formation have yet to be fully elucidated. Recent work suggests a critical role for membrane protein/lipid nanodomains in polarized morphogenesis in plants. One outstanding question is how the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling nanodomains are controlled to achieve robust cell polarization. In this review, we first summarize the current state of knowledge on potential regulatory mechanisms of nanodomain dynamics, with a special focus on Rho-like GTPases from plants. We then discuss the pavement cell system as an example of how cells may integrate multiple signals and nanodomain-involved feedback mechanisms to achieve robust polarity. A mechanistic understanding of nanodomains' roles in plant cell polarity is still in the early stages and will remain an exciting area for future investigations."
